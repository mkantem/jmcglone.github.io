Greetings guys, I trust you are doing well, yes? well it has been a while!

There is not much going on, I just wanted to let you know that I recently gave a talk on the online Radio
MITWS, that stands for Mahanmana Innovative Technologies Walfare Society, [Nawabganj, Bareilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawabganj,_Bareilly) - [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) 

The radio offers a platform to innovators, researchers, industrialist, MSME people, academicians and many others to come together and exchange about their 
respective experiences while informing the general public. 

I intend to contribute to the show with at least a talk per month, even though twice per month would be ideal. My talks will revolve around my research work and 
different area of interests depending on the promoter, Dr Karan Patrap and the topics that can be discussed.

Here is a link (spotify) to my premiere show [https://open.spotify.com/episode/7d1JnOtMgGOPSDfSfrZlxE](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7d1JnOtMgGOPSDfSfrZlxE) 


Tara for now (;
